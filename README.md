# Profile-Likelihood-Confidence-Region-2D-Normal-Distribution
Generate a sample of size n from a 2-D normal distribution, arbitrary mean and covariance matrix.  Find the 1-D confidence intervals for each of the two mean estimates.  
Compute/plot the 2-D confidence region for the mean vector(x,y) and show the 1-D projections onto this confidence region
Python code is set up so confidence interval(s) / confidence region can be found for any/all parameters of the bivariate normal distribution.  
Generated data: supply the mean vector (x,y) and the covariance matrix (2x2)
